You will need to model and analyze your use cases and requirements properly using the appropriate models with the appropriate level of granularity.  For the projects, at a minimum,  you will need to ensure that you have the appropriate sequence diagrams (supporting your use cases), and you will also need to include a class diagram for the different parts of the system.


The reader should be able to understand the different entities in the system (class diagram), how they interact with respect to time (sequence), and the data that is moving throughout the system.


You will need to develop a test plan that will detail the requirements for testing.


Describe at least two design patterns that your team is going to implement for your project. Clearly explain why your team has chosen those design patterns and how they will be implemented.
